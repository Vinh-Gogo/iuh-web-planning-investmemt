## Style Guidelines:

- Background color: Very light red (#F8E6E9), maintains consistency with the primary hue but provides a softer backdrop.
- Accent color: Deep purple (#4E3674), analogous to red, found in IUH's visual identity, to add a touch of sophistication and differentiation to key interactive elements.
- Font pairing: 'Poppins' (sans-serif) for headlines and 'PT Sans' (sans-serif) for body text.
- Use clean, modern icons in a flat style, with the accent color (deep purple) used for interactive elements and red/grey for informational icons.
- Use a grid-based layout with clear visual hierarchy to ensure content is easily scannable. Employ white space generously to improve readability.
- Subtle transitions and animations on hover and click events to enhance interactivity and provide feedback to the user.
